I've used a greedy algorithm for this submission to keep it simple and short.
However, I do realise that a more optimal solution might exist for this specific problem.

My approach:

Aman should always move to the nearest possible location at any given time.
Moving toward any customer requires first picking up their order.
The total fastest travel time is the sum of all the shortest individual travel times.
